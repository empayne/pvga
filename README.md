# pvga

pvga (Pretty Vulnerable Go Application) currently demonstrates six of the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities.
It does so via an incremental clicker game ("Click On This Cat") containing intentionally insecure code.
Search the repository for "OWASP" for some informative comments.

Currently a work in progress.
