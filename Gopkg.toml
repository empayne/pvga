# OWASP Top 10 2017 #9: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
# We have our redundantserializer version pinned to v1.0.0. A newer version
# (v1.0.1) was released to fix its XXE vulnerability, but pvga will not use
# this updated version.
#
# We should specify a more permissive version range (eg. "~1.0.0" will use
# v.1.0.1), or use a tool like Greenkeeper that periodically updates our
# dependencies.
